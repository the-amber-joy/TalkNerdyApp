<h1>Toastmasters Meeting Wednesday February 24, 2016</h1>
<h1>A true inspiration for the children.</h1>
<p>Ummmâ€¦to eBay? I'm Santa Claus! Well, then good news! It's a suppository. Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now: kill Flexo! Tell her you just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating.</p>
<p>What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! 'It is! ' My precious torso! Fry, we have a crate to deliver. Why would I want to know that? <strong> I just told you!</strong> <em> You've killed me!</em> Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them?</p>
<h2>That's not soon enough!</h2>
<p>Oh, I don't have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain. Fry! Stay back! He's too powerful! Is today's hectic lifestyle making you tense and impatient?</p>
<ol>
    <li>For the last time, I don't like lilacs! Your 'first' wife was the one who liked lilacs!</li><li>Hey, what kinda party is this? There's no booze and only one hooker.</li><li>Perhaps, but perhaps your civilization is merely the sewer of an even greater society above you!</li>
</ol>

<h3>Ah, yes! John Quincy Adding Machine. He struck a chord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree.</h3>
